I will need the same docker-compose file, only PWD is different, and again run a mongodb there. Then I can again fetch the files, but now instead of read_json read_csv. AND all in one collection!

Now it's the same as before with FastAPI, but where the Endpoint will be based on turbine id and TIME RANGES :D
